<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>Prisma Cloud introduced runtime protection for apps running on VMware Tanzu Application Service in version 20.09.
The 20.09 tile is available for download from Prisma Cloud Compute Console only (Manage > System > Downloads).
It's not available for download from Tanzu Network.
The 20.12 tile is available for download from both locations.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>If youâ€™re upgrading from 20.04, you must completely remove the 20.04 tile before installing the 20.12 tile.
Version 20.04 and older deployed a single Defender to a single stand-alone VM for blobstore scanning only.
Version 20.09 and newer deploy Defender to every Diego cell to protect your apps at runtime.
Blobstore scanning is still supported with the new deployment architecture.</p>
